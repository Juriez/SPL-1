# Liverage Score Sampling using SVD

This project focuses on implementing Liverage Score Sampling using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in C/C++. Liverage Score Sampling is a technique used for selecting representative samples from large datasets efficiently. In this project, we utilize various algorithms including Bairstow algorithm, Jacobi algorithm, and Gaussian elimination to perform the necessary calculations.
# Features:

    Bairstow Algorithm for Characteristic Equation: Bairstow algorithm is employed to calculate the characteristic equation of eigenvalues, which forms the basis for further computations.

    Jacobi Algorithm for Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculation: Jacobi algorithm is utilized to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given dataset.

    Gaussian Elimination for Linear Equation Solving: Gaussian elimination method is employed to solve linear equations encountered during the computation process.

    SVD Calculation: Singular Value Decomposition is performed to decompose the dataset into singular vectors and singular values, enabling efficient manipulation and analysis.

    Liverage Score Sampling: Liverage Score Sampling technique is implemented to select a subset of representative samples from the dataset based on their Liverage scores.
